Rules:
1. Checkers can only move diagonally on light squares.
2. The opponent’s checkers can be removed from the board by jumping over them if your checker is diagonal
to your opponent’s and there is an empty dark space to hop to.
3. If the space you land on after jumping your opponent’s checker puts you in position to jump another of
their checkers, you can make a “double jump” in one move. A double jump is when two jumps are made 
consecutively within a single turn. (The double-jump feature ability can be turned on or off before the
start of each game)
4. At the start of the game, checkers can only move forward, meaning toward the opposite player's side.
5. Checkers may move up and down when they become “kings” by reaching the last row of the opposite side.
6. The game ends when one of the players is left without any checkers on the checkerboard.
